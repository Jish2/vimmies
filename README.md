# vimmies

my favorite vim motions that i'll never remember

ranked by usage: most 🔥 👍 😑 👎 🗑️ least, new entries added to the top

## normal

- 👍 `` `­` ``: go to position before last jump (undo last `f/F/t/T` motion)
- 🔥 `<C-i/o>`: move positions in jump list

## visual

- 👍 `o`: move to start or end of visual selection

## insert

- 👍 `<C-r><buffer>`: put buffer in insert mode. i mainly use with `"/+` buffer

## commands

- 👎 `:'<,'>norm {motion}`: executes `{motion}` on given visually selected lines

## plugin specific

### telescope

- 👍 `<C-t/v/x>`: go to a file in a new tab, vsplit, or split
